<p>By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy.

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>

<h2>2. Scope of Services & Disclaimer</h2>
<p>CLA is a technology platform, not a law firm. The services provided are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A directory of verified lawyers practicing in Bangladesh.</li>

    <li>A secure "Evidence Vault" for storing and managing case-related documents.</li>
    <li>An AI Legal Assistant for preliminary legal information and document drafting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> CLA does not provide legal advice. The information provided by the AI assistant or anywhere on the platform is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. No attorney-client relationship is formed between you and CLA. Any attorney-client relationship is strictly between you and the lawyer you choose to engage through the platform.</p>

<p><strong>5.2. Client Relationship:</strong> The lawyer, not CLA, is solely responsible for the legal services provided to any client they connect with through the platform. This includes managing conflicts of interest, maintaining client confidentiality, and providing competent representation.</p>
<p><strong>5.3. Fees:</strong> Lawyers are responsible for setting their own fees. All financial transactions for legal services are handled directly between the lawyer and the client, and CLA is not a party to these transactions.</p>
